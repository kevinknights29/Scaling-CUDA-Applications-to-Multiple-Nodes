    "- It's OK if your solution is not any faster than the single-GPU case. We are mostly focusing on writing correct NVSHMEM code in this lab. Given the default value of `NUM_POINTS`, the amount of work per kernel is small enough that we're not really efficiently utilizing the GPU. If you want to do a more realistic performance comparison, set `NUM_POINTS` to a much larger number (but then cap the integration to, say, 10000 steps so that it completes in a reasonable amount of time). You can use the Jupyter notebook `%time` magic function to easily compare application runtime (e.g. `%time !nvshmrun -np $NUM_DEVICES ...`)."
