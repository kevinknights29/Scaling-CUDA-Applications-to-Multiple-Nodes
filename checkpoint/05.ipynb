    "Managing all devices in a single program can be cumbersome. It often looks like what we've been doing so far, where we loop over all available devices and then take the same action (e.g. launch a kernel). The program can be simplified greatly with MPI (the [Message Passing Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface)). When using MPI, we launch the *same* program multiple times independently (the [single-program, multiple-data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPMD) paradigm). In the most common use case, we launch as many independent copies of the process as there are GPUs in your server, and each copy works with exactly one GPU.\n",

    "Each independent process has a unique numerical identifier associated with it (called its **rank**) as well as information about how many total processes are running. We can programmatically obtain the rank for each process (using `MPI_Comm_rank()`) and the number of processes (using `MPI_Comm_size()`). With this information, we can have each rank make independent processing decisions (while still using only one copy of the source code to achieve that). For example, we can (arbitrarily) set the GPU to be used with `cudaSetDevice()` to be equal to the rank (assuming there are at most the same number of ranks as GPUs)."
