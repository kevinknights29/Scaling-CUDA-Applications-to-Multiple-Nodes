This is, for example, what allows you to allocate pinned host memory with `cudaMallocHost` or `cudaHostAlloc` and take its address directly in device code (along with the virtual-to-physical address translation being fixed so that the GPU does not need to talk to the CPU's memory management unit).\n",
