    "A [well-known technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80#Summing_a_circle's_area) for numerically estimating $\\pi$ is to select a large number of random points within the [unit square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_square) and count the fraction that fall within the [unit circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle). Since the area of the square is 1 and the area of the circle is $\\pi / 4$, the fraction of points that fall in the circle, multiplied by 4, is a good approximation of $\\pi$."

We only need to know a point's coordinate to evaluate whether it falls within the circle since for a point with coordinates $(x, y)$, if $x^2 + y^2 <= 1$ then the point falls within the circle, and our counter of the number of points within the circle can be incremented, so long as we handle any race conditions with respect to the counter."
